## Topics: Equivalence among 3 denotational semantics and small step semantics

> In this task, you should first prove **a general theorem which can be used to prove an equivalence between two recursively defined semantics**, and **another general theorem which can be used to prove an equivalence between a recursively defined program semantics and a small step semantics**.
>
> Then, you need to prove the equivalence among three denotational program semantics and a small step semantics.

## TODO

- A theorem which can be used to prove the equivalence between two recursively defined semantics
- A theorem which can be used to prove the equivalence between a recursively defined semantics and a small step semantics
- Prove the equivalence between three denotational semantics ( *plain binary relation, one with time, one with trace* ) and a small step semantics
